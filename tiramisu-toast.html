    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I was really craving tiramisu, but I didn't want to make an entire pan, so what I attempted to do was create a toast-based, individual-sized portion using the same key components. While this wasn't quite tiramisu, this much faster, simpler, easier method was incredible.</p>
<p>Delicious things are bound to happen when you have lots mascarpone around, and thanks to my recent homemade Italian cream cheese adventures, lots of mascarpone is exactly what I had. We used the surplus to make all sorts things, but this Tiramisu Toast was our favorite. While not exactly like classic tiramisu, this featured that same irresistible flavor combination of coffee, marsala, mascarpone, and chocolate, and unlike the original "pick me up," this can actually be picked up.</p>
<p>The other main advantage of this version is that we have the freedom to just make a portion or two, and not worry about what to do with a whole pan sitting around. If you've got a house full of people looking for a pick me up, then by all means, make a whole pan of the real stuff, but Michele and I can only take so much picking up, so this approach works out a little better.</p>
<p>By the way, even if you don't make the entire recipe, the toast component was amazing, and I highly recommend giving that a try regardless. I think I'm going to eventually do a video featuring what was basically coffee French toast, since it really was shockingly good, and the mind reels with possibilities. So, stay tuned for that, but in the meantime, I hope you give this pick-up-able, pick me up a try soon. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the toast:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons strongly brewed espresso</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 (1 inch thick) slices day-old Italian bread</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the mascarpone topping: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons dry Marsala wine</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup mascarpone cheese</li>
        <li>1 tiny pinch salt</li>
        </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking pan with aluminum foil.</li>
    <li>Crack egg into a baking dish. Add white sugar, espresso, and vanilla extract. Whisk to combine. Place bread slices into the dish and toss in the mixture to saturate; let sit for 10 to 15 minutes to fully absorb.</li>
    <li>Transfer bread slices to the prepared pan and drizzle any accumulated coffee mixture liquid over top.</li>
    <li>Bake toast in the center of the preheated oven until custard is cooked and bread bounces back slightly when touched, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer slices to a wire rack to cool to room temperature.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, pour wine into a saucepan. Add sugar and cook over medium heat until reduced to about 1 tablespoon. Remove from heat and let cool.</li>
    <li>Place mascarpone cheese into a bowl and add cooled wine reduction and a very small pinch of salt. Stir with a spatula until combined. Chill before piping or spreading on cooled toast. Top with shaved chocolate.</li>
</ol>
